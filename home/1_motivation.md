# 1. Motivation

I have come to know/observe that virtualization is an essential concept for fast, stable and enviroment agnostic compute, especially for very large workloads.
It's therefore important to learn virtualization, containerization and orchestration of these units.

I consider containers as a homogeneous swarm of cells that help in computing, irrespective of hardware.
